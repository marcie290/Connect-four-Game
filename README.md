## Rules

The objective of Connect Four is pretty straightforward: whoever is the first to form a diagonal, horizontal or vertical line of four of the same colors wins the game.

This means that each player needs to make the right moves and implement proper strategies to connect four tokens while preventing the opponent from doing the same.
